Generate monster stat blocks from CR!

This tool is a bit of a sandbox for me as I experiment with using React. Eventually, it will include controls such as CR, good saves/abilities, number of attacks, damage die, and more!

Use the tool at [https://asacolips.github.io/monster5](https://asacolips.github.io/monster5)
